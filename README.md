# Func-Programming-Haskell

Thorough and in depth course notes and exercises for the Functional Programming in Haskell course taugh by Graham Hutton. There will most likely be a smattering of stuff here in both files of notes, exercises, scripts, stuff from the YouTube videos as well as stuff from the accompanying book if I choose to snag a copy of that. 

The notes in this repo will go across both the FP and AFP courses on YouTube.
